# C++ 11

## How to make a class noncopyable
1. with delete
```c++
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName();
    ClassName(const ClassName&) = delete;
    ClassName& operator=(const ClassName&) = delete;
};
```
2. extend from base class NonCopyable

```c++
class NonCopyable {
protected:
    NonCopyable() {}
    ~NonCopyable() {}
private:
    NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&);
    NonCopyable& operator=(const NonCopyable&);
};

class ClassName : NonCopyable {

};

```

>=delete is a C++11 feature that allows us to explicitly delete a special member function such as constructor, move constructor, copy constructor, copy-assignment operator, move-copy-assignment operator, and destructor. It tells to the compiler to not build the default function. In this particular case, it makes the class noncopyable. Another solution would be to extend the class from NonCopyable.
